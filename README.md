### Overview 📈:
**NotesGym** is a modern APK, thought for students, where you can insert you marks, and the program is calculating automatically your grade averages. 

You need to sign-in with Google or an email adress. 

### Main Features :
- Automatic calculation of averages by subject
- Automatic calculation of general average
- Automatic calculation of the points of the "Double Compensation System" for thoses who live in Switzerland
- Visualization of notes with a graph
- Ability to edit a note after adding it
- Marks and averages exportation in CSV

### Design 🖌️: 
NotesGym is built with a neumorphism style 

### Building 🧱: 
NotesGym was made with Base44, an AI tool to build PWA. After that, I uses Median.co to transform the PWA in a downloadable APK. The APK are coming out a little late on the GitHub repo. If you want the latest version as quick as possible, you can still visit : notesgym.base44.app
